            <h3><u>TUGAS AKHIR SBK 12 IPS U (2022)</u></h3><br>
            <p>A final art & culture assignment presented by SMA Katolik Rajawali Makassar’s 12 IPS U class of ‘22. An assignment which was planned as a drama play turned into a showcase of art performances (consists of short film, singing, music cover, poetry, speech) halfway in production because of the inclining cases of COVID-19. In short, it is both an assignment and a farewell-love letter to the 12 IPS U class of ‘22, starring, edited, written & directed by one of SMA Katolik Rajawali Makassar’s talented student, Jason Kirana.</p>
